# How to contribute

If you use SimpleFi and want to improve it, your help is welcome. The
two main ways to contribute are to log feature requests/bug reports
on Github Issues, or write code yourself and submit a pull request.

## Feature requests and bug reports
You can submit these through the Issues page of the repository. Github
has some helpful default templates you can use.

## Pull requests
If you want to contribute some code, that's great! Please open an issue
first so we can discuss scope, etc. Pull requests shouldn't decrease
overall test coverage, and should follow basic PEP8 guidelines.
